# JPDB Hide Learn Count

### Overview
This extension hides the count of cards left to learn which is usually displayed in the main nav on jpdb.io. This is helpful if you use the site between review sessions but feel like seeing the learn count is little too stressful. I've excluded the `/review` route so that you can still see the "learn" count during reviews 👍🏻
