# Save Audio JapanDict

### Description
When I can't find a word on japanesepod101.com's dictionary, I often turn to forvo.com for help with my Japanese study and flashcard creation. Because Forvo uses some fairly fancy JavaScript to load and play audio files, it is fairly difficult to actually save them off in Chrome. This extension follows in the wake of the other `save-audio-x` extensions in this repo and adds an HTML element to the DOM for each audio recording to make it easier to save the audio files.
