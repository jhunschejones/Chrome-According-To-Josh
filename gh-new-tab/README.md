# GitHub New Tab

### Overview
GitHub README's and documentation currently open html links in the current tab. Sometimes when you're powering through a bunch of linked information, you would prefer for all the links in the README to open in _new_ tabs. This extension allows a Chrome user to toggle this new-tab behavior on and off at the extension level and have it applied to all open GitHub tabs.

Currently this extension works on pages with a top level `#readme` element, as well as issue cards on a project board.
