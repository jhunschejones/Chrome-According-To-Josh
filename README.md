# Chrome According To Josh

### Overview:
This repo houses a growing collection of custom Chrome extensions that I use to make Chrome a nicer place to work and play.

### Installation:
While I do use most of these every day, I don't have the time to work on publishing them to the Chrome extension store at this time. If you're interested in trying any of them out on your machine, they can be loaded in "unpacked" mode by going to `Extensions` > `Manage Extensions` > `Load unpacked`. Make sure "developer mode" is toggled on if you don't see the unpacked option.

As a friendly reminder, you should always read the code before loading an unpacked extension from the internet! üîí‚ù§Ô∏è
