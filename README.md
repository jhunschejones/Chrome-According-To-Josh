# Chrome According To Josh

A small collection of custom Chrome extensions I use to make Chrome a nicer place to work and play.

* [`save-audio-japanesepod101`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Chrome-According-To-Josh/tree/main/save-audio-japanesepod101): Bringing a little HTML to the world of JavaScript audio files on japanesepod101.com.
* [`save-audio-japandict`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Chrome-According-To-Josh/tree/main/save-audio-japandict): Bringing a little more HTML to the world of JavaScript audio files, this time on japandict.com.
* [`save-audio-forvo`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Chrome-According-To-Josh/tree/main/save-audio-forvo): Bringing a little more HTML to the world of JavaScript audio files, this time on forvo.com.
* [`gh-new-tab`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Chrome-According-To-Josh/tree/main/gh-new-tab): Adds a toggle-able extension to force README links on GitHub web pages to open in new tabs.
* [`gh-icons`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Chrome-According-To-Josh/tree/main/gh-icons): Set custom favicons for specific kinds GitHub features to better differentiate between pinned tabs.
* [`zoom-cleanup`](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Chrome-According-To-Josh/tree/main/zoom-cleanup): A wee bit of JS to cleanup those pesky extra Zoom tabs after opening a meeting.
