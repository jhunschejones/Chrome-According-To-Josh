# Clean Copy

### Description
While creating language learning flashcards in Anki, I found there were several sites that included a bit of CSS or other nonsense when I tried to copy a word or a sentence. This extension resolves that issue by stripping the formatting from the text selection on these sites so that you just get the plain text on your clipboard.
