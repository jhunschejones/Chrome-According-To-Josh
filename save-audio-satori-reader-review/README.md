# Save Audio Satori Reader Review

### Description
This extension is a first pass at adding the ability to save sentence audio on Satori Reader's "review" page. Satori Reader has a fairly complex JavaScript player, so I have not yet been able to add a direct download link. With this extension though, a user can click the "play" button and the audio link generated by Satori Reader's JS will be copied to the clipboard.

In the future I may do additional work to bring this extension up to the level of the other `save-audio-*` extensions and add a download button. In the mean time, this works in a pinch!
