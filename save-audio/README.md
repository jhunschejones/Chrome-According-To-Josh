# Save Audio

### Description
I frequently use the Japanese dictionary on japanesepod101.com while studying and making Anki flashcards. Unfortunately, their UI uses a large pile of JavaScript to serve audio clips which makes it a bit unreliable in Chrome. This Chrome extension parses the DOM when dictionary results are loaded and adds a vanilla HTML anchor element for each audio clip for easier accessibility.
