# Save Audio JapanDict

### Description
I recently discovered japandict.com and it's an incredible tool for language learning! I've started using their dictionary results while studying and making Anki flashcards. Unfortunately, their UI uses a large pile of JavaScript to serve audio clips which makes it harder to download in Chrome. This extension parses the DOM when the dictionary results page is loaded and adds a vanilla HTML anchor element for each audio clip. You can right click on this element to save the file, or copy it to paste the content.
