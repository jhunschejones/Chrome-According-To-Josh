# Save Audio Jisho

### Description
When I can't find a word on japanesepod101.com's dictionary, I often turn to jisho.com for help with my Japanese language study and flashcard creation. Though the site does not have audio examples for every word, when they are present I've found them to be good quality recordings. This extension follows in the wake of the other `save-audio-x` extensions in this repo and adds an HTML element to the DOM for each audio recording to make it easier to save or copy the audio files.
