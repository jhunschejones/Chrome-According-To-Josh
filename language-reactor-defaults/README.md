# Language Reactor Defaults

### Description
Language Reactor is a powerful tool for language learning on video sites like Netflix and YouTube. This extension sets some sensible defaults on page load for learners interested in using the tool for Refold sentence mining. Defaults include:
- Clean copy subtitles without furigana
- Hide hover translations on the bottom of the page
- Hide hover translations in side panel by default

To toggle side panel subtitle translations on and off within YouTube or Netflix, you can use the new keyboard shortcut `command + s`. For subtitle translations below the video, use `command + b`.
